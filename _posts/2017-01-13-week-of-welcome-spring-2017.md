The Spring Semester officially kicks off on Saturday January 14th. Welcome back to BC! 
I hope everybody had a great Winter Break. There's no school on Monday, so when you hit campus
Tuesday make sure you're going to your Tuesday courses. We'll be using Canvas which you can 
access through the [BC Portal](https://portal.bakersfieldcollege.edu). 

For those of you who are taking a programming class, it will be a good idea to get familiar with 
which ever IDE you'll be using. I'll be using [JetBrains](http://http://www.jetbrains.com/) products for a majority of my courses.
I will not be spending a significant amount of time on the use of an IDE, I will expect you to read through
the appropriate documentation to become familiar with using your software tools. Our computer labs have several IDE's installed on them
if you'd prefer to use something else.

Regardless of the level of programming course you're in, you can maximize your success by reading. Reading Code.
Reading Documentation. Reading requirements. There are many resources on campus to help you focus on your 
studies. It is in your best interest to become familiar with where on campus you should go for the appropriate help.

Here are a few links to point you in the right direction.
