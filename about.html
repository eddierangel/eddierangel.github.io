<h3>Who I am</h3> 
<p>Hello, my name is Eddie Rangel. I am a Software Engineer, teacher, and all around Californian. I am also a husband and father. We currently reside in Bakersfield, CA.</P>

<h3>A bit more</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in Bakersfield, CA. I attended local schools in East Bakersfield and graduated from Highland High School. 
    My first semester of my post secondary education was at Bakersfield College. After completing one semester and then withdrawing/failing my second semester, I enlisted in the United States Navy.
    I served on board the U.S.S Ramage <a href="http://www.public.navy.mil/surflant/ddg61/Pages/default.aspx">(DDG-61)</a> as an Operations Specialist where I worked in the Combat Information Center. 
    I was on board during the completion of a Mediterraean Deployment in support of the campaing in Kosovo. After I separated from the service, I was more focused and had a better since of direction with what I wanted from college.
    In the Spring of 2002 I restarted on my academic career at Bakersfield College and have been on my current journey ever since.    
</p>
<p>
    I taught my first course as an Adjunct at the Delano Campus with a former collegue where we created a course around the fundamentals of Georgraphic Information Systems. I returned in the Fall of 2014 teaching in the Computer Science
    Department at the main BC campus. I have also taught as a Lecturer in the Computer & Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at CSUB. 
    
    I feel very honored to be able to say that I am apart of the faculty at Bakersfield College.
